> WHY Grayscale conversion??
===>RGB image ko data complex huncha
   >euta image ma 3 layers huncha.. yeslai simplify garna gray scale conversion

> Black=0px, White=1px;
> RGB= 24bits image && Gray = 8bit image.



>Linear interplotation used to shrink or reduce the size of image 
>CubiC interpolation to increase

>>EDGE DETECTION
   technique used (1)sobel
                     collect different height width pixels called Sobel edges
                     poor technique due to high noise
                     not efective
                  (2)LAplacian method
                     Better but still more noise
                  (3) Canny Edge DETECTION`
                  ``    more effective
                        effectively detects edges
                        edges depends on threshold
